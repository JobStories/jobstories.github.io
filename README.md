# JobStories — GitHub Pages site

This repository will be served at https://jobstories.github.io via GitHub Pages.

How to update:
- Edit `index.html` or add other HTML/Markdown files at the repository root.
- To disable Jekyll processing (useful for files or folders beginning with `_`), keep the file `.nojekyll` in the root.

If you want a blog, templating, or collections, consider using Jekyll or another static site generator (Hugo, Eleventy, Next.js). I can create a starter for any of those and add a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy automatically.
